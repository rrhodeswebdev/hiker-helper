Summary:
Hiker Helper is a simple app designed to help users find hiking trail informtaion in a specific area. A user simply has to input a location (city, landmark, address, or national park) and the application will provide a map with trails in that area, along with a 5 day forecast and the list of trails. 

If there are no trails in the specified area, there will be a message stating so. If the location is invalid, there will be an error message as well.

The application provides basic information for each listed trail. Some of this basic information includes the location of the trail, length of trail, ascent and descent, highest and lowest elevations, and a link to see more details on that trail.

Technology Used:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery
